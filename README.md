# Personal Projects
 This repository represents all of my current personal projects that I am working on.

## Current Projects
### CLI Pokemon
* A text-based Pokemon game that you can play on any Unix device, as well as Windows with the necessary tools.
 * Written in C and C++.
 * Utilizes the ncurses library.

## Ideas
### Web-Scraper to Parse ISU Surplus Daily Listing's and compare to a pool of keywords and returns a list of any items that did.
 * Would prefer to write in C++, but Python would probably be most suitable.


### Web-Scraper to Parse Yahoo Finance's Information Regarding Hagan Approved Stocks and Return His Data:
 * Would prefer to write in C++, but Python would probably be most suitable.

### Discord Bot using Java
 * Try and see if Evan, Danny, and Alex want to make our own Discord bot for our server, fun little project.
