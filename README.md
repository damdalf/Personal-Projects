# Personal Projects
 This repository represents all of my current personal projects that I am working on. 
 ## Web-Scraper to Parse ISU Surplus Daily Listing's and compare to a pool of keywords and returns a list of any items that did.
 * Write in C++.
 * Use ncurses to allow the CLI to actually have some kind of interface.

## Web-Scraper to Parse Yahoo Finance's Information Regarding Hagan Approved Stocks and Return His Data:
* Write in C++.
* Also use ncurses, but maybe not, because I have a feeling that parsing Yahoo Finance will be much more difficult.

## Discord Bot using Java
* Try and see if Evan, Danny, and Alex want to make our own for the Discord, fun little project.
