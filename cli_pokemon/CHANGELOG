ASSIGNMENT 1.09: Polishing Up the Game
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/02/2022:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I'm going to be honest, I meant to start working on this over the
weekend but other classes got the best of me. To make things worse, it is
6:57pm currently, and I am just beginning. While this won't be an issue for
the due date of Friday, I would like to be able to demo this by 12:40pm
tomorrow for extra credit. Speed run time!

First, I think it is best to focus on the things that I noticed wrong with my
1.08 solution, and then begin going through the list of 1.09 specifications
from Piazza. As of now, I am electing to start with the more basic features,
which includes:
- Trainers dropping PokeBucks after losing a battle.
	- Everytime a Trainer's Pokemon has been defeated, drop rand() % 100
	PokeBucks for the PC.
- PokeMarts should sell Potions, Revives, and PokeBalls. For the sake of
simplicity, let's have each item cost 100 PokeBucks.
- PokeCenters shall automatically revive and heal all Pokemon on your team for
free.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS:
- Added poke_bucks to Pc class.
- Added PC receiving PokeBucks upon defeating a Trainer's Pokemon. Might be
cool to add the PC receiving PokeBucks upon actually defeating a Trainer.
- Added print_pokemart() with required functionality.
- Added that wild Pokemon encounters only occur while the PC's active Pokemon
has not been defeated. This reduces annoying encounters when a PC is out of
revives.
- Added print_pokecenter() with healing functionality, still need to implement
being able to view all captured Pokemon and swapping one of said Pokemon into
PC's active Pokemon list.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have now begun focusing on the more difficult things to implement, such as
the implementation of a Pokedex and type effectiveness for attacks.

With the viewing Pokedex functionality implemented, it is time to step away
from the swapping functionality and focus on implementing type effectiveness.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS:
- Added Pokedex functionality, able to flip through all pages of one's
captured Pokemon.
	- Have yet to figure out how to swap these Pokemon with a PC's active
	Pokemon. Difficult do since a Pokedex Pokemon can have an index of
	'37' for example. Trying to create a string based off of input is
	weird.
- Added print_six_pokemon(int page);
- Added print_pokedex();
- Added swap_pokemon(int curr_idx, Pokemon pokedex_p, int pokedex_dx);
- Parsed type_efficacy.csv
- Added type effectiveness being calculated when calculating the damage done
by wild Pokemon, an NPC's Pokemon, and the PC's Pokemon.
- Fixed swapping Pokemon from Pokedex to active team of Pokemon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only thing that remained after completing my demo yesterday was prevent
the error which occurred when entering a non-numeric input when prompted to
enter the number of the Pokemon in your PokeDex that you wanted to swap into
your active rotation. I have now resolved this by creating is_number() which
iterates through all characters of the string and ensures that each character
is a digit.

MAY THE FOURTH BE WITH YOU!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATUS:
- Implemented is_number().
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO BE DONE AFTER THIS ASSIGNMENT IS DUE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TODO: Change use_item() to return an int to indicate whether or not an item
 was used or not.
 * TODO: Add display messages for when a move hits.
 * TODO: Flesh out healing system with better messages displayed. Display if
 an item was used on an existing Pokemon, and if not, print a different title in the window to inform the PC that the item was not used.
 * TODO: Add num_escapes as an argument to wild Pokemon battle.
 * TODO: Would be cool if PC's active Pokemon was displayed in a different
 color when viewing the PC's team of active Pokemon.
 * TODO: Remove active_index as I am now regarding the first index to
 always serve as trainer's active Pokemon.
 * TODO: Reorganize order of methods in game_events.h and game_events.ccp.
 * TODO: Clean up (and modulate) code substantially.
