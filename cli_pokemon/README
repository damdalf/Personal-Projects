# CLI POKEMON
This was a project that I had begun working on while taking COM S 327. This class focused on advanced programming techniques using C and C++, as well as the ncurses library. While there is still many things that I'd like to improve and add to the game, my free time is rather unlimited.
## ABOUT THE GAME
Currently there is no end game, and the game does not hold true to any specific version of the game. You can receive any starting Pokemon, and there are Pokemon from several different versions of the game. You can battle other trainers, capture Pokemon, spend your PokeBucks, purchase items, heal your Pokemon, and swap your active Pokemon with those held in your PokeDex.
## THINGS TO BE ADDED
* An end game (E.g. battling in gyms from other areas to become the gym leader)
* Trainer teams (Instinct, Valor, Mystic)
* Text-based animations
