# **Bozo Bot**

---

Hello! This page is quite sparse right now, but I plan to properly complete it soon. In the meantime, here's what's important.

* Here is the necessary invite [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1054158456447316058&permissions=51543013953&scope=bot
) to add Bozo Bot to your server.

For the Discord bot token, this is something that I must keep private to ensure that the bot is not modified by another person. However, if you want to download this code and edit the bot to your likings, simply create a Discord bot and use their Developer Portal to create your own token. From there, look into ways to hide your token (if the bot is made public). After that, enjoy tinkering with the code!

To see a list of the bot's commands, enter ````!help````, and proceed from there. If you encounter any bugs, please create an issue on the GitHub repository. Thank you!
